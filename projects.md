# Our Projects

At **Drive Lab**, we focus on combining data science and veterinary research to address pressing challenges in animal health and One Health.  
Here are some of our ongoing projects:

---

## 🧪 Bacterial Colony Detection
Developing **computer vision pipelines** to automatically detect and classify bacterial colonies from plate images.  
This work supports **mastitis diagnostics**, improving speed and accuracy in veterinary labs.

---

## 🐄 Milk Yield & Avian Influenza (HPAI H5N1)
Analyzing **dairy production data** to evaluate the impact of **highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1)** on milk yield and quality.  
Our goal is to better understand disease burden and potential **zoonotic risks** for farmers and public health.

---

## 📊 Data Integration for Disease Modeling
Building **scalable pipelines** that integrate farm records, laboratory diagnostics, and epidemiological datasets.  
These data systems enable **early detection, monitoring, and predictive modeling** of emerging animal health threats.
